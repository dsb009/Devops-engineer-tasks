A developer Kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. Being a temporary resource for this project we need a temporary user for Kareem. Its a good idea to create a user with some auto expiry date so that user won't be able to access servers once expired.


So create a user named kareem on the App server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-12-07 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

useradd -e 2013-07-30 someuser
