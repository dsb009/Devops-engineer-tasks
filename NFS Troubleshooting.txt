Nautilus production support team was trying to fix some issues with their storage server. Storage server has a shared directory /webdata which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /webdata can be shared among all app servers. Now somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.


Identify the root cause of issue and fix the same to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.

First SSH into storage server ststor01

ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

App servers 

ssh tony@172.16.238.10
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
ssh banner@172.16.238.12

To check if the Files are exported from server the command is 

# exportfs -v 

To check if NFS is installed 

rpm -qa | grep nfs-utils (to validate nfs-utils is installed)

Installing NFS Server and NFS Client

# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib
# yum install portmap (not required with NFSv4)

Now start the services on both server and clients 

# sudo systemctl start rpcbind nfs-server

For old servers 

# /etc/init.d/portmap start
# /etc/init.d/nfs start
# chkconfig --level 35 portmap on
# chkconfig --level 35 nfs on

Configure Export directory

# vi /etc/exports

/appdata <Ipaddress of the client>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

For multiple clinets it should be 

/appdata <Ipaddress of the client>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/appdata <Ipaddress of the client>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

Mount Shared Directories on NFS Client



shows available mounts from CLIENT

#showmount -e <serverIp>

Mount Shared NFS Directory

mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/webdata /var/www/html

Hint: use 
# mount -t nfs -v 172.16.238.15:/webdata /var/www/html
for verbose or detailed for troubleshooting 


To verify run 

# mount | grep nfs

To persist the changes across boot use

# vi /etc/fstab
Add the following new line as shown below:

ServerIP:/nfsshare /mnt  nfs defaults 0 0
