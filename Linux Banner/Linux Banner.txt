During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login


Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host


scp username@b:/path/to/file /path/to/destination

sudo scp thor@jump_host:/tmp/nautilus_banner /etc/motd

vi /etc/motd	

scp /tmp/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/pwd
