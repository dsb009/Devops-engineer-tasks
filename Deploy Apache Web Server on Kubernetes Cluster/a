Task: There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:

- Create a namespace named as httpd-namespace-nautilus.

- Create a service named as httpd-service-nautilus under same namespace, targetPort should be 80 and nodePort should be 30004.

- Create a deployment named as httpd-deployment-nautilus under the same namespace as mentioned above. Use image httpd with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e httpd:latest, and container name should be httpd-container-nautilus. And make sure replicas counts are 4.

Set labels app to httpd_app_nautilus.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


Step 1: 
$ kubectl create namespace <Namespace name>

Step 2: Create the service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: httpd-service-nautilus
	namespace: httpd-namespace-nautilus
spec:
	type:NodePort
	selector: 
		app: httpd_app_nautilus
	ports:
		- port: 80
		  targetPort: 80
		  nodePort: 30004 

--

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
	name: httpd-deployment-nautilus
	namespace: httpd-service-nautilus
	labels: 
		app: httpd_app_nautilus

spec: 
	replicas: 4
	selector:
