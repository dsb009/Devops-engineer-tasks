The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/media.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:



a. Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.

Steps: 

1. Log in to the storage server and allevate the user to sudo 
2. Navigate to the directory and check git status:
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media
    git status
3. Create a new branch named devops ( as Suggested)
    git checkout -b devops
4. Check the new branch status and copy the file
    cp /tmp/index.html .
5. check if the file got copied
    ls -la
6. Now git add and commit the file 
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "added index.html"
7. Git checkout to master and merge the devops branch
    git checkout master 
    git merge devops 
8. push to the devops branch as well as master 
    git push -u origin devops 
    git push -u origin master
