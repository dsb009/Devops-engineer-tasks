We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache’s port i.e 3001 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:


Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

Block incoming port 3001 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.


sudo yum install –y iptables-services

sudo systemctl enable iptables

sudo systemctl enable ip6tables

sudo systemctl start iptables

sudo systemctl start ip6tables

sudo iptables -F

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8083 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8083 -j DROP

sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

sudo service iptables save
