The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application. These template XML files must however be populated with valid data before it can be used. One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries, is to apply string and file manipulation commands!


Replace all occurances of the string About to Architecture on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.

sudo sed -i 's/About/Architechture/g' <filename>
