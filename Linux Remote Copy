One of the developer from Nautilus development team has copied some confidential data on jump host in Stratos DC. That data actually need to be copied to one of the app server. Since developers do not have access to app servers so they asked system admins team to accomplish the task for them.


Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 2 at location /home/code.

sudo scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg steve@stapp02:/home/code

Syntax:

scp <source> <destination>

To copy a file from B to A while logged into B:

scp /path/to/file username@a:/path/to/destination

To copy a file from B to A while logged into A:

scp username@b:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
