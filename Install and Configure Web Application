xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in -progress, but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.

b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/official and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that official should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/official/ and games should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/games. (do not worry about load balancer configuration, as its already configured).

d. You can access the website on LBR link; to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select the option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.




On all App server,

sudo yum install httpd -y

sudo yum install openssh-clients -y

sudo systemctl restart sshd

From JumpHost,

scp -r /home/thor/official tony@stapp01:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/games tony@stapp01:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/official steve@stapp02:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/games steve@stapp02:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/official banner@stapp03:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/games banner@stapp03:/tmp

from any one of appserver move the folder on the correct location

mv /tmp/official /var/www/html
mv /tmp/games /var/www/html
	
Again from all APP server,

change the Listen 8080 at vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

Validate the solution from Jumphost,

curl http://stapp01:8080/games 3
curl http://stapp01:8080/official

curl http://stapp02:8080/games
curl http://stapp02:8080/official

curl http://stapp03:8080/games
curl http://stapp03:8080/official
