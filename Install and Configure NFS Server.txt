For our infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have a requirement to serve our website code from a common/shared location that can be shared among all app nodes. For this we came up with a solution to use NFS (Network File System) server that can store the data and we can mount the share among our app nodes. The dedicated NFS server going to be our storage server. To accomplish this task do the following given steps:


Install required NFS packages on storage server.

Configure storage server to act as an NFS server.

Make a NFS share /data on storage server.

Install and configure NFS client packages on all app nodes and configure them to act as NFS client.

Mount /data directory on all app nodes at /var/www/nfsshare directory (Create the directories if dont exist).

Start and enable required services.

SOlution:

First SSH into storage server ststor01

ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

showmount -e 172.16.238.15

Installing NFS Server and NFS Client(need to be performed on both server and clients)

sudo yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib

Create NFS share Folder

sudo mkdir /appdata 

Configure Export directory

# sudo vi /etc/exports

For multiple clinets it should be 

/data <Ipaddress of the client>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/data <Ipaddress of the client>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

/appdata 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/appdata 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/appdata 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

Now start the services on server

# sudo systemctl start rpcbind nfs-server
# sudo systemctl enable rpcbind nfs-server

# allow NFSv4
# firewall-cmd --add-service=nfs --permanent

# firewall-cmd --reload

On clinets

# sudo mkdir -p /var/www/nfsshare

# sudo yum -y install nfs-utils
# sudo systemctl start rpcbind
# sudo systemctl enable rpcbind

Mount Shared NFS Directory

# sudo mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/appdata /var/www/nfsshare
