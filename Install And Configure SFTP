Some of the developers from Nautilus project team have asked for SFTP access to at least one of the app server in Stratos DC. After going through the requirements, the system admins team has decided to configure the SFTP server on App Server 2 server in Stratos Datacenter. Please configure it as per the following instructions:


a. Create an SFTP user ravi and set its password to ksH85UJjhb.

b. Password authentication should be enabled for this user.

c. Set its ChrootDirectory to /var/www/nfsdata.

d. SFTP user should only be allowed to make SFTP connections.




Step 1: Add user without login shell: 

sudo adduser --shell /bin/false

step 2: set password: 

sudo passwd sftpuser

Step 3: Create a directory: 

sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/files

step 5: Change ownership:

sudo chown sftpuser:sftpuser /var/sftp/files

step 6: And set the owner and group owner of the /var/sftp to root.

sudo chown root:root /var/sftp
sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp

Step 7 â€“ Configure SSH for SFTP

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Match User ravi
	ForceCommand internal-sftp
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	ChrootDirectory /var/www/nfsdata
	PermitTunnel no
	AllowAgentForwarding no
	AllowTcpForwarding no
	X11Forwarding no
	
Step 8: Save the configuration and restart SSH service to apply changes.

sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

step 9: test the connection 

sftp sftpuser@ipaddress

**********************IMPORTANT***********************

Now of you get the following error message: 

packet_write_wait: Connection to 172.16.238.11 port 22: Broken pipe Couldn't read packet: Connection reset by peer

You get this because the home directory for the user or the ChrootDirectory or chain of folders leading down to it must be owned by root.


Permissions requirements:

Note that the owner of the destination directory must be "root", and group/other users cannot have write permissions. The same with all the directory path:
Code:
chown root /path/to/destination
chown root /path/to
chown root /path

chmod g-w,o-w /path/to/destination
chmod g-w,o-w /path/to
chmod g-w,o-w /path
