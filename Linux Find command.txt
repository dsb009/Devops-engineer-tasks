TASK: 

On Nautilus App Server 3 an issue was observed by security team. They found some malicious content within website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find out all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per below mentioned requirements:


a. On App Server 3 at location /var/www/html/beta find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.

b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /beta on same server.

c. Please make sure not to copy entire /var/www/html/beta directory content.


Solution: 

ssh into stapp03

ssh banner@172.16.238.12

cd /var/www/html/beta

find . -name '*.js' -exec cp --parents \{\} /beta \;

However, due to security issues the above should not be used in hard coding. 

Rather you can user this:

You can use find and cpio in pass through mode

find . -name '*.csv' | cpio -pdm  /target

This will find all .csv files in the current directory and below and copy them to /target maintaining the directory structure rooted in '.'

If you use

find /path/to/files -name '*.csv' | cpio -pdm /target
it will find all of the file in /path/to/files and below and copy them to /target/path/to/files and below.
