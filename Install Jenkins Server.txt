Task Details
The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have decided to use Jenkins server. So, we need to setup a Jenkins Server as soon as possible so that we can start our testing. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:


Install jenkins on jenkins server using apt only, and start its service.

Jenkin's admin user name should be theadmin, password should be Adm!n321, full name should be {{ USER_NAME | title }} and email should be {{ USER_NAME }}@jenkins.com.

Note:

For this task ssh into jenkins server using user root and password S3curePass from jump host.

To complete the jenkins installation after installing packages and after starting the jenkins service, click on the + button in the top left corner and select option Select port to view on Host 1, enter port 8081 and click on Display Port.

Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.
