The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.


a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named epel_local and make sure to set Repository ID to epel_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package wget from this newly created repo.
 

Solution:

Create the local yum repo file:

vi /etc/yum.repos.d/epel_local.repo

[local_repo]
name=local_yum
baseURL=file:/packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[epel_local]
Repository ID= epel_local
name=epel_local
baseurl=file:/packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0


createrepo /yum_local/

Clean all:

yum clean all

List all repos:

yum repolist


Install a package using the local repository: 

yum install --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo= “epel_local” wget (may not work)
